# Crime-rate-prediction-and-analysis-using-Machine-Learning-

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting crime rates using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, the project identifies crime patterns, clusters similar data,
and predicts future trends to aid in crime prevention efforts.



Features

-	Data preprocessing and handling missing values

-	Clustering analysis using K-Means

-	Machine learning models for classification and prediction (ANN, SVM, K-NN, Decision Tree, etc.)

-	Data visualization for insights into crime trends



Tools and Technologies

-	Programming Language: Python

-	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

-	Techniques: Feature scaling, one-hot encoding, clustering, and model training/testing



Dataset

The dataset contains historical crime records from various regions. Missing data was handled by replacing
with mean values, and categorical data was encoded using one-hot encoding.



Steps in the Project

1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing

2.	Missing Value Handling
 
3.	Clustering with K-Means

4.	Splitting the Data for Training and Testing

5.	Feature Scaling

6.	Data Analysis and Visualization

7.	Applying Machine Learning Models for Prediction



Insights

-	Identified key crime patterns across different regions

-	Predicted crime rates with high accuracy using advanced ML models

-	Visualized trends for better understanding and decision-making



Usage

Clone this repository and follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the results.



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-rate-prediction.git cd crime-rate-prediction


Future Scope

-	Integrating real-time data for dynamic predictions

-	Extending the analysis to include socio-economic factors

-	Improving prediction accuracy with advanced deep learning models
